# minimal-scala-with-javafx
* A minimal Scala hello-world-app using the Java FX GUI framework, without any other dependencies (such as ScalaFX) 
* Based on https://users.scala-lang.org/t/scala-jdk-11-and-jpms/6102/19 by https://github.com/tarsa
* The only things you need on your local box to do `sbt run`:
  - OpenJDK11  https://adoptopenjdk.net/
  - sbt https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
